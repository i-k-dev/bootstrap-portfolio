# Week 03 Challenge: Portfolio for Course (using Bootstrap CSS)

A web dev portfolio page where I can add more projects to showcase my skills and talents to employers, as the course progresses. 

Compared to previous week's challenge, this one is built using Bootstrap CSS frameworks.

With these points in mind, if I don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, I'll use placeholder images and names. 

## Description

This project takes on the 3rd week challenge which is creating a (better looking) portfolio page for this bootcamp.

This is for practicing the things I've learned and to apply the skills during the 2nd and 3rd module.
